00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,670
Sit down ladies.

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,440
One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.

0
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,210
Can you tell us... How are we supposed
to address the Führer?

0
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,410
The Führer first speaks to you
and then you reply: Heil mein Führer.

0
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,500
And the Nazi salute?

0
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,100
That won't be necessary...

0
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,310
since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier but for a secretary.

0
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,430
Act as normal and calm
as you can.

0
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,550
I'll see if
he has time for you.

0
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,840
Mein Führer
the ladies from Berlin are here.

0
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,320
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

0
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,530
Sometimes during a war
one is not in control of time.

0
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,180
Can I ask your name?
-Margarethe Lorenz.

0
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,300
Where are you from?
-From Fulda.
